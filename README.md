## üìä Data Sources

The data used in this analysis is sourced from:
* **Box Office Mojo:** For comprehensive film box office figures.
* **The World Bank:** For economic indicators like inflation and median income, used in real (adjusted) calculations and economic comparisons.
* **Kaggle:** Aggregated datasets.

**Required Data Files (should be placed in the `data/` directory):**
* `final_box_office.csv`
* `yearly_top10_summary.csv`
* `genre_bridge.csv`
* `production_bridge.csv`
* `US_inflation_data.csv` (for inflation adjustments)
* (Ensure other necessary economic data files like median income are also present if used by Tableau)

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the dashboard running locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name # Replace with your actual repo name
    ```
    *(If you haven't used Git, just ensure you have all the project files in a local directory).*

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating the environment is active.

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required Python libraries using `pip`. It's best practice to have a `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If you haven't created one, here are the core dependencies:
    ```
    # requirements.txt
    streamlit
    pandas
    plotly
    ```

5.  **Place Data Files:**
    Ensure your CSV data files (`final_box_office.csv`, `yearly_top10_summary.csv`, etc.) are placed inside a folder named `data/` in your project's root directory.

6.  **Configure Tableau Workbook Embed:**
    * Open `pages/2_Full_Workbook.py`.
    * Locate the `tableau_embed_html` variable.
    * Replace its placeholder content with the full HTML embed code snippet you obtained from Tableau Public/Server/Cloud for your workbook.

7.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    With your virtual environment activated, navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run 1_Dashboard.py
    # OR, for maximum robustness:
    # python -m streamlit run 1_Dashboard.py
    ```
    (Replace `1_Dashboard.py` with your main dashboard file name if it's different, e.g., `dashboard.py`).

    Your Streamlit app will open in your default web browser.


## üí° Usage
